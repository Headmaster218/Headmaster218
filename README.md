# 👋 Hi, I'm Zhuohang Wu (吴卓航)

🚀 I’m a system-focused engineer passionate about embedded control, robotics, and intelligent system integration.  
🎓 MSc in IoT Systems Engineering @ UCL (2024–2025), BEng in Automation @ NEU (2020–2024).  
🧠 I build things that span hardware to AI — with embedded control as the core and multi-disciplinary systems as the structure.
